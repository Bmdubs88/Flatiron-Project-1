    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies with larger budgets due tend to make more money than smaller ones which elevates the risk of making the movie in the first place. Movies show strong seasonality and the time of the release should not be made at random. Finally, it appears there is marginally higher appeal toward 3-D movies and to the extent it can translate into a higher box office gross is a medium worth further exploring.\n",

    "$Next Steps:$\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) How does including the marketing budget in the total costs translate into the returns on investments for a movie? Is \"bigger still better\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) What are the returns on investments by month of release? There may be opportunities to release movies in less competitive months.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Do 3-D movies actually result in higher audience appeal when comparing the same movie? Do people actually rate the same movie higher if there is a 3-D option or is it possible that 3-D movies are only a fad? How much more money can one expect to make with a 3-D movie?"
